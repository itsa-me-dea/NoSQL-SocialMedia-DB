## Description

My motivation was to build the back end for an social media site that creates and holds a database for `Users` and posts (aka `Thoughts`). There is meant to be interactability between users in forms of `friends` and `reactions` to user posts.

This creates a site that utilizes back-end features by configuring Express.js API to use Mongoose and interact with a NoSQL database. I learned a great deal on how work with json, Isomnia, NoSQL, and Mongoose. Additionally, I found these options to be better alternative to NoSQL and Sequalize. I learned to utilize CRUD methods, virtuals, getters and even got more familiar with using NPM.

## Installation

Starting the Server:
1. Fork or download repository
2. Open a terminal with `index.js`
3. In the terminal, enter `npm i`
4. Enter `npm run start`
5. Open http://localhost:3001/api/ in Insomnia (see [routes folder](./routes/api/) for specific routes)

## Usage

This project will not be deployed. Refer to the following images and associated [tutorial video file](./Assets/screen-capture-NoSQLSocialMediaDB-v2.mp4) or [tutorial video link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QxOnj9Ke32W6slyycdSfq5OkN-C1-Z72/view?usp=sharing). 

To see the full application working, refer to the video links provided [above](#usage). The following images demonstrate:
- GET routes for all users and all thoughts being tested in Insomnia.
- GET routes for a single user and a single thought being tested in Insomnia.
- POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users and thoughts being tested in Insomnia.
- POST and DELETE routes for a userâ€™s friend list being tested in Insomnia.
- POST and DELETE routes for reactions to thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

> **NOTE:** These images are taken after the changes were made (see video).
